<p style="font-size:30">Blackbeard was a famous pirate who terrorized Atlantic shipping from 1717 to 1718 before he was killed in battle in November 1718.</p>
<p style="font-size:30">He often fought wearing a big feathered tricorn hat and brandished several swords, knives and pistols.</p> 
<p style="font-size:30">Blackbeard was famous for putting lit fuses into his hair and beard, which gave off smoke and made him look like a demon in battle.</p>
