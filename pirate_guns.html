<p style="font-size:30">Swivel gun is one of the smallest types of cannons.</p> 
<p style="font-size:30">They were much lighter than normal cannons, so they could be quickly mounted or dismounted on the deck of a pirate ship.</p> 
<p style="font-size:30">Their main purpose was to kill people on deck and repell attackers trying to board.  They were not meant to sink ships.</p> 
<p style="font-size:30">As this weapon was mounted on a swivel, they had great mobility; however, their accuracy was low so the enemy had to be in very close range.</p> 

<p style="font-size:60">Carronade</p>

<p style="font-size:30">Carronade's were short-range cannons that could deliver a large amount of damage.</p> 
<p style="font-size:30">These cannons were mostly used for destroying ships with heavy cannonballs.</p>
