<p style="font-size:30">Captain William Kidd started out his career as a pirate hunter, not a pirate! </p>
<p style="font-size:30">He sailed from England in 1696 with orders to attack pirates and the French wherever he could find them.</p> 
<p style="font-size:30">Soon he was pressured by his crew to commit acts of piracy.</p> 
<p style="font-size:30">He returned to England to clear his name but was instead jailed and eventually hanged as a pirate.</p>
